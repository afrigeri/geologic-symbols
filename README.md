Geologic Symbols for digital maps and GIS
=========================================

Symbology is important in maps, as maps are inherently the symbolic representation, in scale, of the real world or a planet. 

For years geologic maps have been produced by DTP programs, and geologic maps were mere drawings, as in the previous century, when paper was the only media available for map's distribution.

Nowadays, GIS and web-based sloppy maps are spread, and this requires geo-located geology. 

However, we all like beautiful maps, and beautiful geologic maps have beautiful symbols.... so herein we fill the gap!

Enjoy!


WHERE THESE SYMBOLS COME FROM?
------------------------------

For the maniacs of ISO standards, we start to say that there is no standard for geologic symbology.  On one side this allow not to get stuck into limits of a rigid schema, on the other side there will be a 'book of ISO standard geologic symbos' to which refer to.  However, some national level geologic surveys published the symbol set they are using in their official map production.  BGS and USGS did a great job!

We will reference to the original document specification we are using.

This symbol set based on the "Digital Cartographic Standard for Geologic Map Symbolization" ( http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/fgdc_gds/geolsymstd/download.php) as prepared by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC). We implemented the section 25 - Planetary Geology Features

FORMATS
-------

* ESRI
* SVG
* __SE/SLD__ The OpenGIS® Symbology Encoding Standar provides a way to describe symbology indipendentley from the software being used. SLD allows to apply SE to the maps.



PLANETARY WHAT?
---------------

As the authors are working in Planetary Science activities, we are developing our work specifically for planetary mapping, but all this work can be used or extended to our beloved planet, the Earth.

WHY DO I HAVE TO CITE THIS WORK?
--------------------------------

Because, we are working for you! Seriously, developing this it is a time-consuming process - but we believe this project will results in beautiful and more understandable maps abroad.
