## QGIS 3.4 

The FGDC symbols for qgis are located in the xml directory.

You can import them by uploading the file from QGis:

```
Settings -> Style Manager -> Import/Export -> Import Items -> File [then select the xml file]
```

or by specifying the URL


```
Settings -> Style Manager -> Import/Export -> Import Items -> URL
```

then specify the url:


```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afrigeri/geologic-symbols/master/qgis/3.4/xml/fgdc-25.84.xml
```

### Usage notes

convention here is to draw features clockwise, so non-symmetric symbology is displayed correctly.
